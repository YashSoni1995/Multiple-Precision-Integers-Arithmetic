C Codes for Multiple Precision Integers Arithmetic based on Handbook of Cryptography

This Repository contains the C codes for different Multiple Precision Integer Arithmetic based on Handbook of Cryptography. 

These C codes can be used for different optimizations while implementing the Cryptosystems which require high order bit computations.

I have been using these code for implementing different Cryptosystems in WSNs which require a large optimization of operations since they are less power less memory operatable.
